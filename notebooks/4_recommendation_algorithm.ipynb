    "## Introduction\n",
    "In this notebook, we implement a complete recommendation system using the models developed in notebook 3. Our goal is to generate personalized video recommendations for each user in the test set, leveraging the complementary strengths of our different recommendation approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "The recommendation algorithm combines four distinct models:\n",
    "1. Collaborative Filtering (40% weight)\n",
    "2. Content-Based Filtering (30% weight)\n",
    "3. Sequence-Aware Model (20% weight)\n",
    "4. Hybrid Model (10% weight)\n",
    "\n",
    "Each model contributes based on its specific strengths, and the weighted ensemble approach allows us to optimize recommendations by balancing different signals from user behavior and content characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Workflow\n",
    "1. Load the trained models and test data\n",
    "2. Initialize the recommendation system\n",
    "3. Generate sample recommendations for a subset of users\n",
    "4. Create top-10 recommendation lists for all users in the test set\n",
    "5. Save the recommendations for evaluation"

    "We have successfully generated personalized video recommendations for all 1,411 users in our test set, with each user receiving exactly 10 recommendations. The recommendation algorithm effectively combines the outputs from our four distinct models with the specified weights:\n",
    "- 40% from Collaborative Filtering\n",

    "- 20% from Sequence-Aware Model\n",
    "- 10% from Hybrid Model\n",
    "\n",
    "The sample recommendations demonstrate diverse scoring patterns across different users, suggesting that the algorithm adapts to individual user preferences and viewing histories. For example, User 19's top recommendation has a significantly higher score (8.0) compared to User 14's top recommendation (1.8789), indicating strong personalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Achievements\n",
    "1. Implemented a weighted ensemble approach that leverages all four recommendation models\n",
    "2. Generated personalized top-10 recommendation lists for all test users\n",
    "3. Saved recommendations in a standardized format for further evaluation\n",
    "4. Processed recommendations efficiently (21.76 users per second)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps\n",
    "The next crucial phase is to evaluate these recommendations in notebook 5 using established metrics such as:\n",
    "- Precision and Recall at K\n",
    "- Mean Average Precision (MAP)\n",
    "- Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG)\n",
    "- Diversity and Coverage metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "This evaluation will help us determine how well our recommendation algorithm performs and identify potential areas for improvement. We may also experiment with different model weight combinations to optimize performance further."
